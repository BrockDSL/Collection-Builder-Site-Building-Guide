# Welcome!

Welcome to the Collection Builder Site Building Guide!  This guide will walk you through the steps required to build your very own basic Collection Builder site using GitHub pages.  In order to follow through this tutorial, you will need:

1. A GitHub account
2. Some content that you want to exhibit (jpeg's, pdf's, mp3 files, mp4 files, etc.)
3. Metadata for each of those items

Once you have your account and materials ready you can get started.

# Step 1 - Get your Git in Gear

The first step to building a Collection Builder site using GitHub pages is to clone all of the code that works behind the scenes to turn your metadata into an exhibit.  To do this, go to https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh.  You will see a repository containing all sorts files and folders that make up Collection Builder.  What you want to do is create a repository of your own and copy all of those files into it.  Luckily our friends on the Collection Builder team have made this very easy by turning their repository into a template that can be copied easily.

To copy the contents of the repository, click on the green "Use this template" button at the top.  Next, you will need to give a name to your repository.  This will determine what the URL for your Collection Builder Exhibit will be so make sure to pick something that makes sense for your project.  Once you have a good title, check that the bubble for "Public" is checked and then click the green "Create repository from template" button.

Just like that you now have your very own repository with all of the code needed to build a Collection Builder Exhibit!


# Step 2 - Make and Manage your Metadata

The next thing you need to do is prepare your content that will be displayed in your Collection Builder Exhibit.  The most important part of your entire site is the metadata csv file.  This is the file that Collection Builder will use to build all of the item pages, visualizations, and more.  The structure of the metadata file is very impotant as there are some fields that are absolutely required in order for your site to work.  The steps below will help you build a clean, functional metadata file.

1. Start by either creating your own csv file (In Excel, Google Sheets, etc) or by downloading the template by right clicking [HERE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrockDSL/Collection_Builder_Site_Building_Guide/master/metadata-template.csv) and choosing to save target.
